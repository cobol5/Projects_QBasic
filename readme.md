Qbasic Projects
--------------------------------------

The programs in this repository are some of my earliest programming endeavors.  I started programming as a senior in high school using Microsoft Quick basic back in 2001.  

In order to run these programs you will likely need dosbox installed, and a old copy of Qbasic:

Programs
--------------------------------------
**asteroids**: This was meant to be a simple clone of the classic asteroids game, the game features collision detection, bullet firing, a bitmap ship, and shields.  
**CLRSCALE**: This program will draw a bunch of pretty colors on the screen  
**GRAPH**: This program draws a cosine wave and renders it in a graph as you would see in a heart monitor.  
**MATH**: This program performs some arithmetic  
**MFLIGHT**: I wrote this program as a demo for my friend in 2001, it renders a 3d wireframe of a plane and lets you rotate it.  
**MIKE3D**: This program renders a 3d diamond.  
**POLYFILLL**: This program takes random triangles and fills them with random colors.  
**SPLITTER**: When I wrote this program, I only had floppy disks to transfer files between machines, this program will take a large file and split it into pieces that can be re assembled.
